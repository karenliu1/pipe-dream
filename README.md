This is by no means a complete replica, but it has the same basic gameplay as Pipe Dream / [Pipe Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania).

## Rules
* To place a pipe, click an empty square. The pipe cannot be rotated, only placed.
* To replace a tile, just click the occupied square.
* The queue shows upcoming tiles.
* The water begins flowing after the timer counts down. Score points by connecting pipes to the start pipe.
* Press [SPACEBAR] to speed up the flow and score extra points!

## Contributing

To build:

* `npm start` to run the development server (with hotloading)
